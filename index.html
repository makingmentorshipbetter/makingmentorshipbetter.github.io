          Over the course of 2020-2021, we (graduate students in MIT's Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department) collaborated to produce a report on best practices for undergraduate mentorship. Their findings can be found <a href="./2021_report">here</a>. Please let us know what you think at makingmentorshipbetter@gmail.com.
